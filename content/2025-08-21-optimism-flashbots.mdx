**Sequencing has become the frontier in blockchain innovation. We are partnering with Optimism to make the best sequencer in crypto.**

<!--truncate-->

Adopting crypto into their infrastructure is allowing businesses to reach new customers globally, compose existing technologies into full-stack offerings, and drive efficiency in the back office. More than a marginal improvement, crypto lets them build things that simply weren’t possible before.

Inside this bigger trend, launching your own blockchain from ready-made components has emerged as the dominant form factor for many: it’s more customizable and internalizes value better than building on an existing chain, while being cheaper and faster to market than rolling your own system from scratch.

The OP Stack is the most used blockchain infra today, driving [over 60% of L2 transaction activity by REV](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f-uIW_PzlGQ_XFAmsf9FYiUf0N9l_nePwDVrw0D5MXY/edit?gid=584971628#gid=584971628), and powers leading crypto innovators like Base (Coinbase), Unichain (Uniswap), World (co-founded by Sam Altman), Ink (Kraken), and Soneium (Sony).

Today, the OP stack is getting even better. We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with Optimism to **make sequencer customization a first-class platform feature for builders.**

## What this means for OP Stack builders

In 2025, some of the most successful chains make sequencing with Flashbots products a central part of their product strategy:

* Base and Unichain offer their users lightning-fast confirmations via **200 ms Flashblocks** - a 10x upgrade over the standard 2s blocks supported by the OP Stack.

* Unichain and World **use external block building via Rollup-Boost** to support their respective chain visions and ecosystems - Unichain by ordering transactions by priority fee and World by giving priority to verified humans over bots.

* Unichain blocks are **produced inside a TEE**, giving their users verifiably fair and transparent execution and app builders a new primitive to program their execution.

Whether you already operate or are looking to launch a chain today, sequencer customization makes all the reasons for launching on an existing stack even stronger: sequencing helps you make better products, allows you to maximize revenue without harming users, and accelerates your go-to-market by using our battle-tested open-source software.

Beyond the products that already exist today, we are working on a hyper-efficient and MEV-aware sequencer that [breaks past today’s limits to scaling](https://writings.flashbots.net/mev-and-the-limits-of-scaling#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20introduce%20a%20new,becoming%20apparent%20across%20the%20industry), enabling stage 2 rollups with [TEE proofs](https://atanetwork.notion.site/External-Block-Production-TEE-Proofs-for-OP-Stack-10c10e97025a8066b402c8ab13167c26), and making it super simple to enable sequencer customizations like cancellation prioritization or off-chain transaction validity checks.

## Next steps

We are thrilled to partner with Optimism to further establish it as the best option for sequencing in crypto.

If you’re an existing OP Stack builder, expect these benefits to gradually roll out over the coming months.

If you’re thinking about launching a chain today, talk to us or Optimism about how using Flashbots sequencer products can create more value for your users, internalize the MEV they create, and go to market faster and cheaper.
